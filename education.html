                        <p>
                            I'm super excited to be studying here at BYU for my undergraduate degree! Originally, when I 
                            applied to BYU in 2023, I was enrolled in the College of Fine Arts to pursue a degree in Theater Education.
                            However, after re-evaluating what I wanted my lifestyle and career to look like, I decided to 
                            pivot to pursue Human Resource Management. I adored theatre in high school, and I still do! 
                            I was a stage manager for four years, where I developed organization and interpersonal skills 
                            that helped me fall in love with helping and supporting others to shine.
                            I decided that although I do love theatre, I want to enter a career field that has the potential 
                            for remote work so I have the opportunity to stay home and raise my children. I was also finding myself without 
                            the intellecutal challenge I thrive on when using analytical perspectives.
                            I reflected on the digital and communication skills I've developed, the empathy I have for others and the passion 
                            I have for digital systems. What I realized is that many of the skills I used in my theatrical work as a 
                            stage manager would transfer wonderfully to human resource management!
                            I love teaching others, training them, defining and refining positions within a workplace, and creating systems 
                            that allow others to fulfill their passion more efficiently. 
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="subheading">Learning so Far</h1>
                        <p>
                            I declared myself a pre-business major in August of 2024, with the intent of applying to BYU's HRM program in June of 2025.
                            So far, I have had the opportunity to take a series of business pre-requisites that have taught me many invaluable skills 
                            and attitudes! I have resparked my inclination for analytical thinking in Statistics, accounting, marketing, and information
                            systems classes. I am eagerly absorbing the knowledge from those around me and finding connections across subjects/fields, and
                            building entirely new skillsets (see <a href="skills.html">skills</a> for more).
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="subheading">Going Forward</h1>
                        <p> I strive to listen and understand other peoples' 
                            motives and goals, and to help them find the right environment to thrive. With this drive, I know I will be a successful 
                            HR manager! However, I have a lot to learn before I get there.
                            I actively seek opportunities to learn of things that inherently pertain to HRM and things that don't.
                            I believe being well-rounded is an invaluable characteristic that allows people to thrive in various aspects of our lives.
                            Above all else, I seek to love all people the way Jesus Christ does. I have a fundemental belief in His love for us, and His desire for us to be successful.
                            This is ultimately what drives me to seek understanding and growth in myself and others.
                        </p>
